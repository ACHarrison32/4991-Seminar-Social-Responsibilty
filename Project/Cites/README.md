|[Flood Prediction](https://dl-acm-org.msutexas.idm.oclc.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3516529.3516530)|This article talks about a flood prediction system in Kerala, India. It talks about how they are coming up with a system that uses machine learning algorithms and also uses Artificial Intelligence modules such as SHAP and LIME.|
|[Forest Fire Prediction](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/9/1813) |This article talks about the effects of the forest fires in Heilongjiang China and what researchers have done to help predict forest fires. By using Artificial Neural networks they are able to predict forest fires a lot faster so they can take the necessary precautions to prevent mass damage.|
|[Wather Forecast Prediction](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/16/3209) |This article talks about how artificial intelligence is helping to predict weather forecasts. Artificial intelligence techniques will be implied to help with weather forecasts, climate monitoring, and decadal prediction.|
|[Climate Change Prediction](https://github.com/ACHarrison32/4991-Seminar-Social-Responsibilty/blob/main/Project/Cites/ClimateChangeArticle.pdf) |This article talks about how artificial intelligence is helping to understand the effects of climate change. It uses an artificial neural network to understand the combination of greenhouse gasses and industrial aerosols and sees how they have influenced global temperature in the past, present, and future. |
|[Earthquake Prediction](https://github.com/ACHarrison32/4991-Seminar-Social-Responsibilty/blob/main/Project/Cites/ContentServer.pdf) | Looks at methods based on artificial intelligence for predicting the greatest earthquake ground motion early |
